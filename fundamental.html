  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>class</td>
    <td>In the Java(TM) programming language, a type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object.

The intent is that the core classes for the Java platform, at minimum, are available on all operating systems where the Java platform runs. A program written entirely in the Java programming language relies only on core classes, meaning it can run anywhere</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Encapsulation</td>
    <td>The localization of knowledge within a module. Because objects encapsulate data and implementation, the user of an object can view the object as a black box that provides services. Instance variables and methods can be added, deleted, or changed, but as long as the services provided by the object remain the same, code that uses the object can continue to use it without being rewritten.</td>    
  </tr>

    <td>field</td>
    <td>A data member of a class. Unless specified otherwise, a field is not static.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  <tr>
    <td>GUI</td>
    <td>Graphical User Interface. Refers to the techniques involved in using graphics, along with a keyboard and a mouse, to provide an easy-to-use interface to some program.</td>

    <td>A Java(TM) programming language keyword used to define a variable of type integer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>keyword</td>
    <td>The Java(TM) programming language sets aside words as keywords - these words are reserved by the language itself and therefore are not available as names for variables or methods.</td>

    <td>literal</td>
    <td>The basic representation of any integer, floating point, or character value.</td>

</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>A Java(TM) programming language keyword used in a method or variable declaration. It signifies that the method or variable can be accessed by elements residing in other classes.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>static</td>
    <td>A Java(TM) programming language keyword used to define a variable as a class variable. Classes maintain one copy of class variables regardless of how many instances exist of that class. "static" can also be used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are invoked by the class instead of a specific instance, and can only operate on class variables.

    <td>subarray</td>
    <td>An array that is inside another array.
