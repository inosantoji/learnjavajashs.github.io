<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h2><b>What is Java?</b><br><br>
Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
<br>
Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java.
<br><br>
Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
<br><br>

<br>



 
<b><h3>Application</h3></b>
According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:
<br>
Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
Mobile
Embedded System
Smart Card
Robotics
Games, etc.<br><br>
<b>Types of Java Applications<br><br></b>
There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:
<br><br>
<b>1) Standalone Application</b><br>
Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.
<br><br>
<b>2) Web Application</b><br>
An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.
<br><br>
<b>3) Enterprise Application</b><br>
An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.
<br><br>
<b>4) Mobile Application</b><br>
An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
<br><br>
<b>
<br>
Prerequisite</b><br>
To learn Java, you must have the basic knowledge of C/C++ programming language.

<b><h3>History of Java</h3></b><br><br>
Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time.<br><br> The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. <br><br>Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.<br><br><br><br>

The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, <br>Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. <br>James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.
<br><br>
<b>James Gosling - founder of java</b>
Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. There are given significant points that describe the history of Java
<br><br><br><br>
